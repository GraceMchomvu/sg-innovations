# 🚨 NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX - URGENT

## ❌ **Current Issue:**
Your Netlify deployment is failing due to:
1. **Build command using `--turbopack`** (not compatible with static export)
2. **Unescaped apostrophes** in Contact.tsx
3. **Wrong publish directory** configuration

## ✅ **SOLUTION - Follow These Steps:**

### 1. **Update Your GitHub Repository**

**CRITICAL:** You need to push these fixes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Key Files That Were Fixed:**

#### **package.json** ✅
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "next build",  // ← REMOVED --turbopack
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint"
  }
}
```

#### **next.config.ts** ✅
```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
};

export default nextConfig;
```

#### **netlify.toml** ✅
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "out"  # ← CORRECT directory

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"

# Disable Next.js plugin to avoid conflicts
# [plugins]
#   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### **Contact.tsx** ✅
- Fixed all unescaped apostrophes
- Converted to Netlify Forms
- Removed API route dependency

### 3. **Netlify Configuration**

**IMPORTANT:** In your Netlify dashboard:

1. **Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy**
2. **Make sure these settings match:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
   - Node version: `18`

3. **Disable Next.js Plugin:**
   - Go to Plugins section
   - Remove/disable `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` if present
   - This conflicts with static export

### 4. **Force New Deployment**

After pushing to GitHub:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. Or push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong:**

1. **Turbopack Issue:** 
   - Error: `> next build --turbopack`
   - Fix: `> next build` (removed --turbopack)

2. **Apostrophe Issues:**
   - Error: Unescaped `'` in JSX text
   - Fix: Used `&apos;` for text content

3. **Publish Directory:**
   - Error: Using `.next` instead of `out`
   - Fix: Set `publish = "out"` in netlify.toml

4. **Next.js Plugin Conflict:**
   - Error: Plugin trying to use server features
   - Fix: Disabled plugin for static export

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

After these fixes:
- ✅ Build will succeed
- ✅ Static files generated in `out/` folder
- ✅ Contact form works with Netlify Forms
- ✅ Site deploys successfully

## 🚀 **Deploy Now:**

1. **Push fixes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment - remove turbopack, fix apostrophes, correct publish dir"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Netlify deployment**
3. **Your site will be live!** 🎉
